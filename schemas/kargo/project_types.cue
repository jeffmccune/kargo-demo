// #Projects defines the structure of a kargo project, useful for kargo
// related components to look up data given a ProjectName.
#Projects: [NAME=string]: #Project & {name: NAME}

// #Project defines the structure of a project configured for progressive
// rollouts with Kargo.  The structure composes one Holos #Project with one
// Kargo #Project.
//
// We define an abstraction over both kinds of projects, holos and kargo,
// because the two are closely related but not the same.  We want to keep the
// concerns separate with loose coupling.
//
// The Holos Project is used to associate multiple related components together
// and isn't concerned with Kargo.
//
// The Kargo Project is used to define a progressive rollout promotion pipeline
// across multiple stages.  For example, Kargo handles the business use case:
// automatically promote from dev to test to uat, then submit a pull request to
// promote to production.  On merge, roll out to production across regions from
// east to west, verifying each deployment is healthy before proceeding to the
// next.
//
// See the #ProjectBuilder for how concrete values of this schema are built from
// a collection of components and stages.
